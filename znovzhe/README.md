# ZNO NE ZA HORAMY

A new Flutter project.
## English US
### Getting Started

This project is a timer for the high school graduates in Ukraine. It counts the time to the Ukrainian final exam, also called as External Independent Evaluation(EIE), by which they enter a university.

### Functionality:
1. Counts the time to the EIE.
2. Counts the time for each subject(because the tests for each subject are conducted on seperate days)

### Advantages:
1. User-friendly UI
2. A couple of animations
3. Interactive theme(the accent color depends on the time left to EIE)
4. Pretty fast(uses native code - flutter sdk)
5. Dark mode switch.
